Development Workflow

* FOCUS only on the specific task requested
* AVOID introducing new patterns or technologies when fixing bugs
* MAINTAIN existing implementations unless explicitly asked to change
* CONSIDER what other parts of the codebase might be affected by changes
* TEST every change before considering it complete
* COMMIT frequently with descriptive messages
