Testing Requirements

* WRITE end-to-end tests for all major functionality
* PRIORITIZE integration tests over unit tests
* NEVER use mock or stub data in dev or production environments
* ONLY use mock data in test environments
* ENSURE tests actually verify real functionality, not just pass
* RUN all tests before any deployment
