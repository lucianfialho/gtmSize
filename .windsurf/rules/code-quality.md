Code Quality Standards

* ALWAYS prefer simple, readable solutions over complex ones
* NEVER duplicate code - check if similar functionality exists before creating new code
* STRICTLY maintain separation between dev, test, and prod environments
* ONLY make changes that are explicitly requested - do not touch unrelated code
* AUTOMATICALLY refactor files that exceed 200 lines
* ALWAYS write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
